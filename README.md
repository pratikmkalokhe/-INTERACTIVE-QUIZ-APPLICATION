##This project involves building an interactive Quiz Application using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The goal is to create a user-friendly and responsive app that allows users to answer multiple-choice questions and receive instant feedback on their selections. The application dynamically loads questions one at a time from a pre-defined set or via an external JSON file, enabling scalability and content flexibility. Each question features four options, and users receive immediate visual feedback indicating whether their answer is correct or incorrect. After an answer is submitted, the correct option is highlighted, and users are guided to the next question. At the end of the quiz, a final score is displayed along with a message based on performance, encouraging engagement and replayability.
